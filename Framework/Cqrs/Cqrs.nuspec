		<description>A lightweight enterprise framework to help write CQRS and Eventsourcing applications in C#, with a special focus on deploying to Azure.</description>
		<summary>
			Written in C# and targets .NET 4.0, with the exception of some Azure packages which target .NET 4.5.

			CQRS.NET has been designed with modularity in mind. There are a number of supplementary technology packages you can chose from. Every package and design choice made should be interchangeable with custom code if needed.

		<releaseNotes>
			Version 1.601

			* Added built-in Linq To SQL data store and event store modules to speed up time to market. This enables the use of just the one CQRS package to get to market. This adds a new configuration property "SqlDataStoreDbFileOrServerOrConnection" to the appSettings.
			* Added Sql script for creating an event store table on SqlServer. Look in the Tool folder of the nuget package folder.
			* An example for using the new Sql modules for data persistence and event sourcing can be found at our GitHub repository. Look for the 'Samples\CqrsWeb' Project.
			* Added a repository builder and data-store builder to entities in UML.
			* Added code generation for the base Host class.
			* Added an event store service class so event can be queried by CorrelationId for external services that don't have access to the bus network.
